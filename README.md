# Adventure Life - book your favourite outdoor activity

## Disclaimer

This was an educational projecct during my studies in BAAA (Business Academy Aarhus)

## Overview

This was an interdisciplinary project at the end of I.semester of Web Develpment. The ultimate purpose was to utilise four major study subjects: **Front-end**, **Back-end**, **Databases**, and **Interface Design**.

As a result, a website must have been built for a fictional company, that has some sort of a booking system with an administration area where the bookings can be handled. No premade CMS was used in the development of this project, only us students with some C#, SQL and Sass skils.

More info coming later.
